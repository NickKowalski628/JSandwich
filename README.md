This program will allow the user to choose a sandwich combination of three meats and three breads with the price changing dependent on the chosen meat. 
In this assignment I dove deeper into utilizing javax.swing to create a simple GUI that the user could use to interact and "create" their ideal sandwich.
Also in this assignment, I implemented input validation to ensure that the user had selected a valid combination to get the correct output. 
The expected inputs are the bread and meat choices from the user and the expected outputs would be the price depending on what the user chooses. However,
this program will not display a price unless a valid combination of bread/meat is selected.
